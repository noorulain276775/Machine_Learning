Have you ever been amazed by how google home and Amazon Alexa assist in finding Information when asked over voice.
</br>
Have you ever windered that how e-commerce companies send you personalized email for shopping suggestions
based on the product that you bought online recently.

It is all because of machine Learning that these virtual Assistants and product recommendations work swiftly

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence, that uses data, algorithms and Statistical techniques to build intelligent systems, these systems learn by themselves and improve with the experience.

## What is the goal of machine learning?
THe goal of machine learning is to build a computer that imitate a human behaviour

## Examples of usage of machine Learning

<ul>
<li>Self-driving Car</li>
<li>Medical Imaging</li>
<li>Diagnotics</li>
<li>Speech recognition</li>
<li>Facial Recognition</li>
<li>Natural Language processing (NLP)</li>
</ul>

## What is Required for Machine Learning?

#### 1. Good knowledge of Programming Language
A good command on most preferably Python and R.

#### 2. Computer Science Concepts
###### Data structures
1. Queues
2. Stack
3. Trees
4. Graphs

###### 3. Alogrithms
1. For seraching and sorting
2. Dynamic and Greedy Programming
3. Space and time complexity


###### 4. Libraries (For data analysis, computation and visualization)
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Tidyr
6. Ggplot

###### 5. Applied Mathematics
To understand the mechanism behind the Alogrithms, you need to have a good knowledge of mathematical concepts such as:
1. Linear Algebra
2. Calculus
3. Statistics
4. Probability


###### 6. Data Wrangling and SQL
Machine Learning expert often work on raw data collected from various resources, that are not fit for analysis. It has been observed that 80% of data analysis spend too much time on data wrangling. So, It is cruical for machine Learning expert to clean structure and enrich raw data into a desired format and make it ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques.

Machine learning tasks invloves using data stored in the form of tables that are present inside relational database. The good understanding of SQL commands enables you to store, manipulate, retrieve and handle structured data.

###### 7. Machine Learning Algorithms

<ul>
<li>Supervised Learning</li>
<li>UnSupervised Learning</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
</ul>

###### 8. Data Modeling And Evaluation

The job of a machine Learning engineer is to train the best performing model possible depending on the problem at hand you will need to choose a suitable error measure and an evaluation strategy for machine learning model.

## What is Supervised Learning?
It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

## What is Unsupervised Learning?
This type of learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.

## What is reinforcement Learning?
Learning with the past experience(feedback) is known as reinforcement learning.
